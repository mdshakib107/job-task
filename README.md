# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [University.info](https://relaxed-hopper-2cee8f.netlify.app/).

## There is no unique key in this API which is giving a little warning.

and the api is little bit slow so give time while loading data.and after deployment the api is not working i think it's because of using https but if i give HTTP then netlify make some problem for fetching data
